# ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 2 minutes

# Write a Python function, fourthPower, that takes in one number and returns
# that value raised to the fourth power.
#
# You should use the square procedure that you defined in an earlier
# exercise (you don't need to redefine square in this box; when you call
# square, the grader will use our definition).
#
# This function takes in one number and returns one number.

def fourthPower(x):
    '''
    x: int or float.
